## How it works

1. [Install](https://github.com/apps/mergeable) the Mergeable GitHub App.
2. [Configure](#configuration) your recipes. Here are some [examples](#examples).
3. Commit and push the configuration to your repository at `.github/mergeable.yml`

## Vision

Our goal is to empower teams with the ability to automate the software development workflow through GitHub and other tools purely through configuration.

We want to make it really easy to automate and connect apps used in software development from Trello to GitHub to Slack and more!

## Examples

WIP

## Configuration

Mergeable is highly configurable. You can configure mergeable by creating a `.github/mergeable.yml` file in your repository.

WIP:
<!-- - Validators
- Actions -->

 The old [version 1 format](version1.md) of configuration will continue to work.
